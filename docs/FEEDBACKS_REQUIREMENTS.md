Gemini 2.0 feedback for the file: docs/REQUIREMENTS.md


Yes, I think this is a **good** system design requirements file, especially for its purpose, which appears to be a learning exercise or a relatively straightforward project. It covers many important aspects of system requirements and is well-structured for a microservices architecture.

Here's a breakdown of why it's good and some areas where it could be even better:

**Strengths:**

- **Well-Organized and Structured:** The file is logically divided into clear sections (Functional, Technical, Service, Communication, Constraints, Non-Functional). This makes it easy to navigate and understand.
- **Microservices Architecture Focus:** It clearly outlines requirements for each microservice (FileUploadService, FileProcessorService, FileStorageService) and their interactions. This is crucial for designing and developing a microservices-based system.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** It touches upon many essential aspects, including:
  - **Functional Requirements:** What the system _does_ (file upload, processing, metadata extraction).
  - **Technical Specifications:** Constraints and limitations (file size, formats, encoding).
  - **Service-Specific Requirements:** Detailed needs for each service (authentication, workflow, processing capabilities, storage management).
  - **Shared Requirements:** Protocols, communication methods, shared definitions.
  - **Performance Expectations:** Outlines desired performance for each service.
  - **Scalability Considerations:** Addresses the ability to scale the system.
  - **Communication Requirements:** Specifies inter-service communication methods.
  - **Constraints:** Implementation and technological limitations.
  - **Non-Functional Requirements:** Code quality and learning objectives.
- **Clear Language:** Generally, the language is clear and easy to understand.
- **Specific Details where Necessary:** For example, specifying file size limits, supported formats, encoding, and concrete technologies like Go, SQLite, Docker, gRPC, NATS.
- **Inclusion of Proto Definitions:** Highlighting the use of Protocol Buffers for interface definitions is excellent for microservices communication and contract definition.

**Areas for Improvement:**

While good, here are some areas where the file could be improved to make it even stronger, especially in a more formal or complex project context:

- **Measurable and Testable Requirements:** Some requirements are a bit vague. For example:
  - "Rapid authentication" - How rapid? Milliseconds?
  - "Minimal overhead in upload coordination" - Quantify "minimal."
  - "Clean, readable code" - While important, this is subjective. Consider more objective code quality metrics or standards (e.g., code complexity limits, static analysis tool usage).
  - **Improve Performance Expectations:** Be more specific about performance targets. For example, instead of "Low-latency token generation," specify a target latency (e.g., "Token generation latency should be less than 10ms in 99% of cases"). Similar quantification could be applied to processing time, retrieval times, etc.
- **Non-Functional Requirements (Expanded):** Consider adding more detail to other common non-functional requirements, such as:
  - **Security:** Beyond authentication, consider data security (data at rest and in transit encryption), vulnerability management, authorization policies.
  - **Reliability & Availability:** What are the expectations for uptime and fault tolerance?
  - **Maintainability:** How easy should it be to maintain and update the system? (While "clean code" touches on this, more could be specified).
  - **Usability (for Operations/Admin):** While user-facing usability might not be the focus, operational usability (monitoring, logging, administration interfaces) might be relevant.
- **Prioritization of Requirements:** In a real-world project, it's crucial to prioritize requirements. Consider adding a mechanism to indicate the priority of each requirement (e.g., Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have for Now - MoSCoW method, or simple High/Medium/Low).
- **Stakeholders and Context:** While possibly implied, explicitly stating who the stakeholders are and what the overall business need or problem this system addresses would provide more context.
- **Error Handling and Resilience (More Detail):** While "Error handling" is mentioned in FileProcessorService, expanding on general error handling strategies, retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and fault tolerance across services would be beneficial for a distributed system.
- **Learning Objectives Section (Context):** The "Learning Objectives" section is a bit unusual for a standard system requirements document. If this is for an educational purpose, it's understandable. However, in a professional setting, this section might be separated or rephrased to be about project goals rather than strictly system requirements. If the primary goal _is_ learning, it's perfectly valid to include it, but its context should be clear.

**Overall:**

This is a well-structured and comprehensive requirements file, particularly good for learning about microservices and system design. By addressing the areas for improvement, especially focusing on making requirements more measurable and testable, and expanding on non-functional requirements and prioritization, it could become even stronger and more applicable to a wider range of projects. For its apparent purpose (learning or a smaller project), it is **very good and serves its function effectively**.
