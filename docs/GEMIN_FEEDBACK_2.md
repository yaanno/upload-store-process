Okay, that's excellent context! Knowing it's a learning project dramatically reshapes the priorities.  The focus now shifts from production-grade robustness and scalability to **educational value and learning specific technologies**.

Yes, for a learning project, focusing on understanding the core concepts is absolutely the right approach.  Your revised understanding of the project's purpose perfectly justifies adjusting the action plan.

**Revised Action Plan for a Learning Project (Confirmed and Adjusted):**

Your revised action plan based on the learning purpose is spot on! Let's re-iterate and slightly refine it based on your confirmation:

1.  **gRPC Streaming for Upload/Download (Primary Learning Focus):**
    *   **Action:** Implement gRPC client-side streaming for `UploadFile` and server-side streaming for `DownloadFile`.
    *   **Learning Goals:**  Deeply understand gRPC streaming concepts in Go:
        *   Protobuf stream definitions.
        *   Server-side stream handling (`Recv()`, `SendAndClose()`, `Send()`).
        *   Client-side stream creation and sending (`Send()`, `CloseAndRecv()`).
        *   Error handling in streaming scenarios.
        *   Bridging HTTP file streams to gRPC streams in the `upload-service`.
        *   Potentially, learn about backpressure in streaming (though might be advanced for initial learning).
    *   **Priority:** **Highest Priority**. This is the most technically challenging and valuable learning aspect for this project.

2.  **"Good Enough" Error Handling and Logging (Fundamental Practices):**
    *   **Action:** Implement structured logging (using your chosen logger package).  Ensure you log errors, warnings, and important events throughout the services. Use `status.Errorf` for gRPC error responses.  Handle basic errors gracefully without excessive complexity.
    *   **Learning Goals:** Understand best practices for logging and error handling in Go services:
        *   Structured logging benefits.
        *   Logging levels (info, warning, error).
        *   Returning appropriate error codes (gRPC status codes, HTTP status codes).
        *   Basic error checking and handling.
    *   **Priority:** **High Priority**. Good fundamental practices are always important to learn.

3.  **Basic Event Publishing/Subscribing with NATS (Event-Driven Concepts):**
    *   **Action:** Implement basic NATS publisher and subscriber functionality in `upload-service`, `storage-service`, and `process-service` to demonstrate event flow (e.g., file upload events, processing events). Keep the event payloads simple for learning.
    *   **Learning Goals:** Grasp the core concepts of event-driven architecture:
        *   Publish/Subscribe pattern.
        *   Loose coupling of services through events.
        *   Asynchronous communication.
        *   Basic NATS usage in Go (connection, publishing, subscribing).
    *   **Priority:** **Medium-High Priority**. Good for understanding event-driven architectures, a common pattern.

4.  **JWT Authentication for API Access (Basic API Security):**
    *   **Action:** Implement JWT generation in `storage-service` (for upload tokens) and JWT validation in `upload-service` (for HTTP API). Protect the HTTP `/v1/files/upload` endpoint with JWT middleware.
    *   **Learning Goals:** Learn about basic API security with JWT:
        *   JWT structure (header, payload, signature).
        *   JWT generation and signing.
        *   JWT validation.
        *   Applying JWT middleware for authentication.
    *   **Priority:** **Medium Priority**.  Good for learning basic API security practices.

5.  **Keep SQLite and Local Filesystem Storage Simple (Focus on Core Logic):**
    *   **Action:** Continue using SQLite for metadata storage and local filesystem storage for file storage.  Focus on making the core logic (streaming, eventing, authentication) work correctly.
    *   **Learning Goals:**  Avoid getting bogged down in database or storage complexity for this learning phase. Keep these components simple to focus on the primary learning objectives.  You can explore more advanced storage or database options in *separate* learning exercises later if desired.
    *   **Priority:** **Low Priority (Keep as is).**

6.  **Basic Metrics and Health Check (Optional - Nice to Have, if Time Permits):**
    *   **Action:** If you have extra time, implement very basic `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints.  These are "nice-to-have" but not essential for the core learning objectives.
    *   **Learning Goals (if implemented):** Get a basic understanding of:
        *   Exposing metrics for monitoring.
        *   Implementing health checks for service readiness.
    *   **Priority:** **Optional/Low Priority**.  Implement if you have extra time after focusing on the higher priority items.

**Learning Path Recommendation:**

1.  **gRPC Streaming Implementation:** Start with implementing gRPC streaming for `UploadFile` and `DownloadFile` in the `storage-service`.  This is the most technically challenging but also the most rewarding learning aspect.
2.  **Error Handling and Logging:**  As you implement streaming, pay close attention to error handling and logging throughout the services.
3.  **NATS Eventing:** Integrate NATS event publishing and subscribing for basic event flow between services.
4.  **JWT Authentication:** Add JWT authentication to secure your HTTP upload endpoint.
5.  **(Optional) Metrics and Health Checks:** If you have time after the above, implement basic metrics and health checks.
6.  **Iterate and Experiment:** Don't be afraid to experiment, refactor, and learn by doing. Break down the tasks into smaller steps and test frequently.

By focusing on these learning objectives, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience with key distributed systems concepts and technologies, even with a simplified project scope.
