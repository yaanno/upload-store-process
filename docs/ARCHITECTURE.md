# System Architecture

## 1. Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
- Learning-focused microservices implementation
- Simplicity over complexity
- Clear, educational design patterns

### Architectural Goals
- Demonstrate microservices communication
- Implement event-driven workflows
- Showcase Go programming practices

## 2. Communication Strategies

### Hybrid Communication Model
- **Synchronous (gRPC)**
  * Critical, immediate interactions
  * Presigning upload URLs
  * Authentication checks

- **Asynchronous (Message Queues)**
  * Background processing
  * Event-driven workflows
  * Decoupled service interactions

## 3. Service Interactions

### Backend Service
- Coordinates file upload workflow
- Manages initial user interactions
- Generates upload tokens
- Initiates storage and processing flows

### Storage Service
- Handles file storage mechanisms
- Implements file compression
- Manages file metadata
- Provides secure file access

### Processor Service
- Processes uploaded files
- Extracts basic metadata
- Performs text transformations
- Handles background processing tasks

## 4. Data Flow

```
User Upload Request
↓
Backend Service (gRPC)
├── Validate Request
├── Generate Upload Token
└── Initiate Storage Process
    ↓
    Storage Service
    ├── Compress File
    ├── Store Metadata
    └── Publish Upload Event
        ↓
        Message Queue
        └── Processor Service
            ├── Process File
            └── Store Results
```

## 5. Key Design Decisions

### Communication
- gRPC for immediate interactions
- NATS/Kafka for event-driven communication

### Storage
- Local filesystem
- SQLite for metadata
- Zstandard compression

### Processing
- Minimal, learning-focused transformations
- Support for text-based files

## 6. Performance Considerations

- Concurrent upload support
- Minimal processing overhead
- Efficient message routing

## 7. Scalability and Limitations

### Current Scope
- Single-node deployment
- Limited to text file processing
- Minimal error handling

### Future Potential
- Distributed architecture
- Advanced processing capabilities
- Enhanced error management

## 8. Technology Choices Rationale

### Go Language
- Strong typing
- Excellent concurrency support
- Compiled performance
- Simple syntax

### gRPC
- Efficient binary communication
- Strong typing
- Built-in streaming
- Language-agnostic

### Message Queues
- Decoupled service communication
- Scalable event handling
- Reliable message delivery

## 9. Security Considerations

- Basic token-based authentication
- Secure file upload mechanisms
- Minimal attack surface
- Learning-focused security model

## 10. Monitoring and Observability

- Basic logging
- Performance metrics
- Simple error tracking

## Conclusion

A deliberately simple, educational microservices architecture focusing on core distributed systems concepts.
