Yes, generating the `storage_upload_token` on the `storage-service` side is **absolutely a good and recommended approach!** In fact, it's the most logical and secure place to generate and manage these tokens.

Let's break down why it's a good approach and the benefits it provides:

**Reasons Why `storage-service` Should Generate `storage_upload_token`:**

1.  **Centralized Security and Authorization Logic:**
    *   **`storage-service` is the Authoritative Service for Storage:** The `storage-service` is responsible for controlling access to the storage, enforcing storage policies, and validating operations related to file storage. Generating the `storage_upload_token` within the `storage-service` keeps the authorization logic where it belongs – with the service that controls the resource (storage).
    *   **Single Point of Token Generation and Validation:** By generating and validating the token in the `storage-service`, you have a single, authoritative point for managing the security and authorization of file uploads. This reduces complexity and makes security policies easier to enforce and audit.

2.  **Token Scope and Context are Defined in `storage-service`:**
    *   **Token Scoping:** The `storage_upload_token` is specifically for authorizing the `UploadFile` operation *within* the `storage-service`. The `storage-service` understands the context of the upload (file ID, user, storage location, expiration, etc.) and can generate a token that is appropriately scoped to this context.
    *   **Contextual Information:**  The `storage-service` has access to the file metadata repository, storage provider configurations, and other internal state needed to create a meaningful and secure upload token.

3.  **Reduced Responsibility and Complexity in `upload-service`:**
    *   **`upload-service` as API Gateway:** The `upload-service` is primarily acting as an API gateway, handling HTTP protocol concerns, authentication (JWT), and routing requests to backend services. It should ideally delegate complex business logic, especially security-sensitive logic related to storage, to the `storage-service`.
    *   **Simplified `upload-service` Logic:** By delegating `storage_upload_token` generation to the `storage-service`, the `upload-service` remains focused on its core API gateway responsibilities and doesn't need to be burdened with the details of token generation and storage authorization.

4.  **Improved Security Architecture:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The `upload-service` doesn't need to know the secrets or logic for generating `storage_upload_token`s. It simply requests a token from the `storage-service` and then uses it. This adheres to the principle of least privilege – each service only has the necessary knowledge and capabilities for its specific role.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface of `upload-service`:** If token generation logic were in the `upload-service`, and if the `upload-service` were compromised, the attacker might gain access to token generation keys or logic, potentially allowing unauthorized uploads. By keeping token generation in the `storage-service`, you isolate this security-sensitive function to the service that directly manages storage.

5.  **Natural Workflow for `PrepareUpload`:**
    *   **Request for Upload Credentials:** The `PrepareUpload` call from the `upload-service` to the `storage-service` can be naturally viewed as a *request for upload credentials*. The `storage-service` then responds with the `storage_upload_token` (the credentials) that the `upload-service` can then provide to the client.

**Workflow with `storage-service` Generating Tokens:**

1.  **Client Requests Upload Preparation (HTTP to `upload-service`):**
    *   Client (web browser, etc.) sends an HTTP request to the `upload-service`'s `/v1/files/prepare-upload` endpoint (or similar). This request likely includes JWT for user authentication and metadata like `filename`, `file_size`, `file_type`.

2.  **`upload-service` Handles HTTP and Calls `storage-service`'s `PrepareUpload` (gRPC):**
    *   `upload-service`'s HTTP handler validates the JWT (authentication).
    *   It then makes a gRPC call to the `storage-service`'s `PrepareUpload` method, forwarding the relevant information (filename, file size, user context derived from JWT).

3.  **`storage-service` Generates `storage_upload_token`:**
    *   The `storage-service`'s `PrepareUpload` method performs authorization checks (based on user context, file metadata, service policies).
    *   If authorized, it generates a `storage_upload_token`, associates it with the `file_id`, sets an expiration, and stores this token mapping (e.g., in a cache or database).
    *   It also creates file metadata in the database with `ProcessingStatus = "PENDING"`.
    *   It returns the `PrepareUploadResponse` to the `upload-service`, including the `storage_upload_token`, `global_upload_id`, and potentially a `storage_path` (though `storage_path` might be determined later during actual upload).

4.  **`upload-service` Responds to Client (HTTP):**
    *   `upload-service` receives the `PrepareUploadResponse` from the `storage-service`.
    *   It forwards the `storage_upload_token`, `global_upload_id`, and other details in the `PrepareUploadResponse` back to the web client via HTTP in a `PrepareUploadHttpResponse`.

5.  **Client Uploads File (HTTP to `upload-service`):**
    *   The client now uses the `storage_upload_token` (and `global_upload_id`, file ID, etc.) obtained in the previous step to make the HTTP POST request to the `upload-service`'s `/v1/files/upload` endpoint, including the file content in the multipart form.

6.  **`upload-service` Handles HTTP and Streams to `storage-service`'s `UploadFile` (gRPC Streaming):**
    *   `upload-service`'s HTTP handler validates JWT (authentication - could be skipped if already done in PrepareUpload, or re-validated for extra security).
    *   It then initiates a gRPC streaming call to the `storage-service`'s `UploadFile` method, forwarding the `storage_upload_token`, `file_id`, and streams the file content in chunks.

7.  **`storage-service` Validates `storage_upload_token` and Stores File (gRPC `UploadFile`):**
    *   The `storage-service`'s `UploadFile` method receives the stream of file chunks.
    *   **Crucially, it validates the `storage_upload_token`** to ensure it's valid, not expired, and associated with the correct `file_id`.
    *   It proceeds with the file upload process (metadata updates, calling `storageProvider.StoreFile`, event publishing).

**In summary, having the `storage-service` generate the `storage_upload_token` is the correct and most secure design choice. It centralizes authorization logic, maintains clear service responsibilities, and fits naturally into the two-step upload workflow you've designed with `PrepareUpload`.**
