# Testing Strategy for Upload Store Process

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive testing approach, focusing on integration testing for microservices.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Testing
- Located in `tests/unit/`
- Test individual components and functions
- Focus on logic, edge cases, and error handling
- Use `testify/mock` for dependency mocking

### 2. Integration Testing
#### Approach
- Dockerized service testing
- Centralized test client for consistent interactions
- Workflow-based test scenarios

#### Key Components
- **Test Client**: `/tests/integration/testclient/client.go`
  - Provides a unified interface for service interactions
  - Supports complex multi-step workflows
  - Handles connection and authentication

#### Test Workflow Example
```go
func (s *IntegrationTestSuite) TestFileUploadWorkflow() {
    // Demonstrates a complete file upload process
    uploadResp, err := s.testClient.UploadFileWorkflow(
        "test.txt", 
        []byte("test content"), 
        "test-user-123"
    )
}
```

### 3. Integration Test Suite Features
- Docker-based service startup
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Consistent test environment
- Supports complex interaction scenarios

### 4. Test Execution
Use Taskfile commands:
- `task test` - Run unit tests
- `task test:integration` - Run integration tests
- `task test:all` - Run all tests

## Best Practices
- Keep tests independent
- Use meaningful test names
- Cover both happy paths and error scenarios
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use environment-based configuration

## Tools and Dependencies
- `testify` - Assertion and mocking
- `dockertest` - Containerized testing
- `grpc` - Service interaction
- `buf` - Protobuf management

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update test coverage
- Review and refactor test cases
- Add performance and stress testing

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check service configurations
- Verify network connectivity in tests

## Future Enhancements
- Add more comprehensive workflow tests
- Implement chaos testing
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
